## Cutting-edge analytical tools:
-Excel – dataset extraction format
-Power Query Editor – cleaning of data
-Power BI – data visualization 
	    -[Download here] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494?…)
-Data Analysis Expression (DAX) – to perform mathematical calculation.

The choice of tool often depends on factors like the nature of the dataset, the complexity of analysis needed, ease of use, and the specific requirements of the project and directors report preferences.


## Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach in analyzing data sets to summarize their main attributes, often employing visual methods. Its primary goal is to understand the data, its patterns, and trends by answering some crucial questions:
1.	What is the total revenue amount generated by Qtr, Month and Day?
      ![](https://github.com/Henry-Eze/ABC-BI-ANUAL-SALES-REPORT./blob/main/REVENUE%20SUMMARY%20BY%20LOCATION.png)
2. What is the total cost incurred - using DAX to calculate it?
3. What is the Profit %
4. Sales by region
5. What is the sales per customer?
6. What is the total number of customers - using DAX to calculate it?
7. Picture of the salesperson

9. Top three performing products

## Data Analysis:
In Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), several metrics and calculations can be performed to determine revenue by month, week, day of the week. Here are some common calculations related to the created measures:

## Findings
1. It is evident that some products does not sale very well in some days in different geograpghical zone
2. Some Sales representatives did not meet the overall sales target in this period in view
3. The profit % increased fron in the months of January - February and a sharp increase from May to June
4. Choco Coated Almonds, Fruit & Bites bars and 70% Dark bites are the best contributor to the overall profit %
5. Europe and North America are the major selling region with the highest sales revenue
6. April has the highest total cost  without a corresponding revenue.


## RECOMMENDATIONS
Enhancing sales and optimizing operations are critical objectives for many businesses. Here are several recommendations that could help achieve these goals:
1.	Customer Segmentation: Segment your customer base based on demographics, purchasing behavior, or other relevant criteria. 
2.	CRM Implementation: Implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors, enabling more targeted sales and marketing strategies.
